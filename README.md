# Robot
The program has been written to satisfy the requirements of the Mocking Robot project, a CSCE-635 Artificial Intelligent and Robotics courseâ€™s final project at Texas A&M University. The purpose of the program is to simulate a robot system that is able to detect a yellow ramp entrance of a mobile hospital and run over it to get inside the hospital. The project is based on the motivation that a robot cart can handle medical materials for Ebola Emergency Treatment Units. The program is written for an iRobot Create. To test the program, the robot is placed in a random location within a few feet from the ramp. It must autonomously find the ramp and get to the other side in less than one minute. 

The program has been required to use machine learning and computer vision. The program makes use of machine learning in order to detect which side of the ramp it is initially placed; section three describes in detail the machine learning algorithm. The program makes use of computer vision by using two separate cameras, attached to the rear of the robot, one high and one low. The higher one is used to find the ramp from far away and move towards it using a potential attractive field. The lower camera is used in combination with the machine learning algorithm to classify the side of the ramp the robot is on.
